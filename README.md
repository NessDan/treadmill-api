# treadmill-api

Just open-sourced this repo. It was never meant to see the light of day, please forgive my code quality ðŸ˜…

I take no responsibility for what you do with this code. No guarantee it'll work with your treadmill. If this causes damages, deaths, sadness - that's not on me!

I take full responsibility for any goodness that comes from it though! ðŸ˜œ

# Supplies

* Get a breadboard, you'll thank me later.
* I used a [Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/) (with headers!)
* The white prototype board on top is the [Adafruit Perma Proto Bonnet Mini Kit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3203)
* The blue thing I was soldering was a "4 Channel IIC I2C Logic Level Converter Bi-Directional 5V to 3.3V"
* The treadmill motor control board provided 12v power, so to power the Pi I bought a "DC-DC 12V to 5V Micro USB type Single USB Converter Step Down Power Module"

# Pre-req

* [Watch my Twitch stream where I talked about the creation of it.](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/322752054)
* [Photo album with schematics used for Raspberry Pi](https://photos.app.goo.gl/CpD3yuzWCkEzSbVP8)
