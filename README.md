# treadmill-api

Just open-sourced this repo. It was never meant to see the light of day, please forgive my code quality ðŸ˜…

I take no responsibility for what you do with this code. No guarantee it'll work with your treadmill. If this causes damages, deaths, sadness - that's not on me!

I take full responsibility for any goodness that comes from it though! ðŸ˜œ

# Pre-req
