1. Setup USB SSH: https://desertbot.io/blog/headless-pi-zero-ssh-access-over-usb-windows
1. Change .bashrc HISTSIZE and HISTFILESIZE to be unlimited
1. Run `sudo raspi-config` and update everything accordingly.
1. sudo apt install git
1. Setup git settings
1. Setup SSH Private key + Add it to Github
1. Git Clone the repo, `git clone git@github.com:NessDan/treadmill-api.git`
1. Inside the repo make a file named "password", the value is used for https auth.
1. Install NVM like normal (no special setup for Pi)
1. `nvm install --lts` (installs latest lts node)
1. Run this command to allow node to be run as sudo (for GPIO access): https://stackoverflow.com/a/29903645/231730
1. Install pigpio, `sudo apt install pigpio`
1. `npm install` in the git repo
1. Install certbot `sudo apt-get install certbot` for letsencrypt
1. Start the project in a nohup, `nohup npm start &`
1. In the same directory, run `sudo certbot certonly --webroot -w ./static -d treadmill.nessdan.net`
    1. This will hit the treadmill API's HTTP server and create a certificate.
    1. After the script is run, kill the nohup server.
?1. Automate renewal by running `sudo crontab -e` and adding this entry:
    `@monthly sudo certbot renew`
    (Can remove ? after 3 months if https still works)
    NOTE TO FUTURE SELF: found this command in a crontab for the old drive:
        `0 0 * * 0 letsencrypt renew`
        If the above doesn't work, this may work?
1. Start the treadmill API on bootup, `sudo nano /etc/rc.local`
    Add `cd /home/pi/treadmill-api && npm start` before the "exit"
